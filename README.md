Scripts to take Rock Band DLC/customs as LIVE/CON packages,
and extract them to their separate files, sorted by song identifier.
Then, repackage any arbitrary set of songs into a new CON package.

Requires Ruby, Python and Mono.
Uses [`arkem/py360`](https://github.com/arkem/py360)
and [DJ Shepherd's X360](https://github.com/mtolly/X360)
(with [additions by me](https://github.com/mtolly/onyxite-customs/tree/master/haskell/build/resources/vendors/xbox)).
